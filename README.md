# Life-Board-Game-Probability-Calculator

<p>
  This Java program calculates the probability of landing on the first 34 tiles of the board game Life. The variables overflows after 34, rendering the calculations inaccurate.

<p>
  <b>Quick explanation of the Math:</b> In a nutshell, the probability of landing on each tile is different in the board game Life because the further a space is from the start, the more the combinations of the spinner number resulting in landing on a space increases--but not infinitely and not linearly. For example, the probability of landing on the 1st tile is 1/10. But the probability of landing on the 2nd tile in the course of the game is 11/100 because you can either spin a 2 on your first turn or spin a 1 two turns in a row. The data extracted from this program was used to create a graph and observe the tendencies.

  <b>Why did I make this?</b>
  <ul> <li> The recursive nature of the algorithm makes it hard, inefficient, and error prone to calculate the results by other means than a computer program.</li> <li>This program was made to support my internal assessment for IB Math. The results help determine mathematically whether it is more advantageous to start with a career or go through college. </li> <li>I also thought it would be a fun project to do.</li>  </ul>

"Exploration_math√©matiques_finale.pdf" is my written report that was sent for evaluation, explaining all the Math and how I used the results of this program. Unfortunately, the entire document is in French. Luckily, there are many graphs, tables, and equations so everyone should still be able to grasp the general idea behind the project and the methods that I used.
